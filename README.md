# What has been done

I believe all the requirements have been fulfilled. The Graphql part was defenitly challenging, as I have not tried the technology before. You will see that in file .\server\src\mock.js the getPersonById funciton is a bit ditry. But it works :)

I have autogenerated some mock data for my mock REST APi using faker package. The mocked data resides in db.json file in the root. For the mock REST api I used json-server.

All code for the Graphql server resides inside the ./server directory. I used apollo.

Please, follow steps below to run the app.


## Available Scripts

There are 3 scripts that need to be executed:
1. The client - the web app
2. The server - appollo
3. The web service with mocked data

# How to run it

## Install dependencies.

Run `npm istall` form both the root level and from server directory.

## Start the client

In the terminal navigate to the root of the project and execute 

`npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Start the mock service

In the terminal navigate to the root of the project and execute 

`npm json-server`

Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in the browser.

## Start the Server

Navigate to server directory and execute 

`node src/index.js`

Starts the server on [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

# Posibble improvements

If I had more time, I'd do the following:
1. Cleanup Graphql to return the Person data including the asociated facility and exposure without doing it manually (see getPersonById() funciton in .\server\src\mock.js)
2. Move the RESt api code to a separate folder, as it does not really belond inside the web app
3. Make styling mobile friendly. Ups.
4. Update the input onChange handler. At the moment it removed the vhole value if a non digit is typed. It should just ignor (remove) that non digit character, rather then removing the whole thing.
